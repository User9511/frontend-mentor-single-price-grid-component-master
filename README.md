## My process

![](./design/my-process.png)

I opened the desktop design in Adobe Photoshop and then I broke the design down into different containers using yellow & red boxes. This is a visual aid that I allows me to see how I'm going to layout the different elements on the page using CSS Grid / Flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript to make change the text of a HTML element on mouseover using innerHTML.

### Useful resources

- [HTML DOM Element innerHTML](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp) - This helped me to change the button text on mouseover.
